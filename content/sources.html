      <p>
        When someone looks for Open Access research using the Button, we want to be sure the article or data is not already available before we contact authors.
        We can't search the entire web, so we rely on up-to-date indexes of institutional and thematic repositories from around the world. 
      </p>

      <h3>Starting with identifiers</h3>

      <p>
        We start off by pulling identifying information about the research, which in loose order of preference can be:
        <b>URL</b>, <b>DOI</b>, <b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">Pubmed</a> ID</b>, <b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">Pubmed Central</a> ID</b>, <b>article title</b>, or <b>citation</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If given a URL, we check the URL itself to see if it contains a DOI, PMID, or PMC ID. If so, we extract that identifier. 
        For example, here is a URL with a DOI in it:<br><br>
        http://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1758-2946-3-47<br><br>
        If we don't find an identifier in the URL, we search the page
        content for DOI, title, PMID, and PMC ID - if we find one, we use it as our priority identifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        If given a full citation or a title, we search <a href="https://www.crossref.org/">crossref</a> 
        for a DOI and title that appear to match.
        If we can't find anything from a citation, we try to pull the title, then check crossref again with just that.
      </p>

      <h3>Finding by Pubmed ID and Pubmed Central ID</h3>

      <p>
        Now, if we have a PMID or a PMC ID, we search <a href="https://europepmc.org/">Europe PMC</a>. 
        If we find an Open Access article there, we're done!
        If we find a paywalled article there, we try to find the DOI and title for it.
      </p>

      <h3>Finding by DOI</h3>

      <p>
        We prioritise DOI searches over title searches, and we search for DOIs in the following order, stopping as soon as
        we find a link to an open article:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://europepmc.org/">Europe PMC</b></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.share-research.org/">Share</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://oadoi.org/">OA DOI</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://dissem.in/">Dissemin</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.base-search.net/">BASE</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://core.ac.uk/">Core</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.openaire.eu/">Openaire</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a></li>
        <li><a href="doaj.org">DOAJ</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Do you think we should add more sources? <a href="/about#contact">Let us know</a>!
      </p>

      <p>
        If we don't find the research we're looking for, we try to grab other information, such as the title. 
        If that doesn't work, we check <b>crossref</b> with the DOI and extract a title if available. 
      </p>

      <h3>Finding by title</h3>

      <p>
        If we have a title, we go back to the sources where title searches are accepted 
        (sometimes records in these sources don't include the DOI):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Europe PMC</b></li>
        <li><b>Share</b></li>
        <li><b>BASE</b></li>
        <li><b>Openaire</b></li>
        <li><b>Core</b></li>
        <li><b>Figshare</b></li>
        <li><b>DOAJ</b></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Last resort</h3>

      <p>
        If we can't find the article anywhere, but we have the journal name, we check <b>DOAJ</b> 
        to see if the journal is registered as Open. 
        If it is, we return the URL to the journal itself, so that the user can look for the article manually.
      </p>

      <h3>What about "open but needs login"?</h3>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, many repositores contain "open" articles, but require a login - which is not very open. 
        Wwe manage a list of such repositories, and, if a URL matches one, we do an additional check
        to see if the item can be accessed without a login. If it can't, we don't consider it open.
      </p>

      <p>
        (There are a few other sites that we blacklist outright, for various reasons.)
      </p>

      <h3>What about institutional access?</h3>

      <p>
        Some of our users are members of institutions, such as universities, that have additional access
        rights to some content. In these cases, we'd love to collaborate on customised plugins, bookmarklets, and search
        methods (such as integration with your library ex-libris search) that check whether or not "local"
        access is possible. You can also build your own using <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/api">our API</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
       We also hook up to inter-library loan systems and send alerts or triggers for ILL requests! 
       If you're interested in this, <a href="/about#contact">contact us</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>If all else fails, start a request</h3>

      <p>
        When we can't find an open version of research anywhere, it's time to start a request!
        We search the page content and metadata for the principal author's name and email address, and create a new request
        on our system. We collect accessibility and licence information from <b>DOAJ</b>, 
        <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php">Sherpa Romeo</a>,
        and <a href="https://lantern.cottagelabs.com/">Lantern</a>. 
        Then we contact the author and ask them to provide a legally accessible copy - 
        either with a URL to something we couldn't find, or by uploading it. If an
        author uploads an article to us, we store it in <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, so it's
        available long-term. 
        Where the request is for a research dataset, we store uploads with the <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Foundation</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our user community also help to fulfill requests, by providing author email addresses, additional
        metadata, or additional sources. Users can also add their support to others' requests. By collecting the stories
        of users requesting access, we present compelling arguments why an author should share their research.
